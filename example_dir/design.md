## New Feature: Markdown Handling

**Demo:** This file! This file was written in markdown and is being served as an HTML file.

An additional demo file can be found [here](http://ec2-52-26-164-101.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/static1/markdown.md)

### Implementation 

* Extended our `StaticHandler` to detect files that feature the `.md` extension. 
* Utilized the [cpp-markdown](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cpp-markdown/) library
